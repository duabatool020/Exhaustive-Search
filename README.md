# Exhaustive-Search
This Program will solve the Problem given below:<br>
Find the optimal solution of following problem using Exhaustive search. Submit complete
working.<br>
Suppose you have an assignment with different parts labeled A through G. Each part has a
“value” (in points)and a “size” (time in hours to complete).<br>
For example, the values and times for the assignment are as given below:<br>

<br>
a) If you have a total of 15 hours to do the assignment, which parts should you do?<br>
b) What is the best total value (in points) possible?<br>
